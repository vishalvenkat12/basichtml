<!DOCTYPE html> This defines the type of HTML file. It is HTML5 here.
<html lang="en"> We're setting the language as English.
<head> This part doesn't appear in the webpage.
<meta charset = "UTF-8">
<title> The title </title> This appears as the name of the webpage in tab.
</head>
<body> Everything inside body tag appears in the webpage.
<h1> My first heading </h1>
<p> My first paragraph </p>
